# Authentication 

## Authentication of organizations

Organizations become member of the network of organizations by the Trusted Third Party that issues a membership credential to the organization that is member of the network. Ideally, an organization would be able to identify itself by presenting some form of iditification from a trusted source such as the Kamer van Koophandel (KvK) or an UZI attribute from GIBG. Once an organization has a membership to the network, it can present this credential as proof of membership and thereby authenticate its identity as part of the network. The Tusted Third Party is responsible for issuing these memebership credentials.
